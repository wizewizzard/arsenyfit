####Yii1 project
Current project combines blog and shop services. As it is easy to divide project into several controllers, except the main one, the only complementary module  implemented is admin module which provides the customer shop and shipping managment, an opportunity to update news page, consultations schedule and gallery. An ordinary guest is able to sign up for consultation or to make an order in the shop via a cart. They may track down the shipping status for their goods or cancel order unless it was already sent.<br/>
As the customer experienced some problems registerring his business or paper scurry (I don't know the exact reason) he called the project off and it was suspended. <br/>
Besides some cosmetics the last step - recieving Webmoney and/or PayPal APIes and futher implementing had to be done.
